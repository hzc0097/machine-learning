abstract
The goal of this project is to provide an effective tool for players and spectators of the game League of Legends to analyze high-level matches and the players within them in order to predict overall win chances, while illuminating which objectives are the most important to achieve in order to secure a win. With the inclusion of aggregative scoring based on hundreds of thousands of individual player statistic points, this tool can accurately and effectively predict a playerâ€™s win-chance based not just on their current performance, but a weighted average of their performance across their game history. The final model that we decided on is a two layer neural network with a hidden layer size of 70. This model can predict victories with an accuracy of approximately 97% on our train dataset and 96% on our test dataset.
